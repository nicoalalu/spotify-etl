# Spotify API tutorial

Store your Spotify playlists automatically for further analysis!

This code is used to obtain and store information about songs in a specific playlist and their audio features in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis. You will be able to know which songs are the most popular, acoustic, danceable, and more!

It is necessary to have a registered user on Spotify and an application created on the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) to obtain the necessary credentials (client_id and client_secret) and place them in the config.ini file and a valid redirect URL to place in the spotipy_redirect_uri section of the config.ini file

To learn how the Spotify API works with its respective parameters, here is the [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

This code uses the "configparser" library to read credentials from a configuration file called "config.ini". It is necessary for the config.ini file to be in the same directory as the script and to have the following sections and parameters:

------------------------

[spotify]
- client_id= <your_client_id>
- client_secret= <your_client_secret>
- spotipy_redirect_uri= <your_redirect_uri>
- playlist_id = <your_playlist_id>

[general]

- path_file = <your_path_file>
------------------------
To learn how this ConfigParser works on python, here is a brief [tutorial](https://www.onlinetutorialspoint.com/python/python-how-to-read-config-ini-files.html) with examples

Once configured, the code uses the "spotipy" library to connect to the Spotify API with those credentials and a specific scope of "user-read-recently-played".


## Requirements

* python 3.6 or higher
* spotipy 2.13.0 or higher
* pandas 1.1.4 or higher
* configparser 3.8.1 or higher
